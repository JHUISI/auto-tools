Assigning FID 0 to every unit polynomial 1

Adding set : 
F0 = 1 in G1
F0 = 1 in GT
F1 = a in G1
F2 = b in G1
F3 = x in G1
F4 = a*y in G1
F5 = b*x + b*y in G1
None of the rules are applicable on following PPE problem 
Trusted set in G1: F0 = 1, F1 = a, F2 = b, F3 = x, F4 = a*y, 
Trusted set in GT: F0 = 1, 
Untrusted set in G1: F5 = b*x + b*y, 
Untrusted set in GT:
